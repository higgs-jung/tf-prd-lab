# Ideation run — 2026-02-14 04:12 (Asia/Seoul)

Context: Repo appears idle (no open PRs/issues). Generate 1–2 small, high-leverage next steps.

## Candidate ideas

### A) Repo healthcheck script + CI
**Problem:** Drift accumulates: broken docs links, missing expected files, inconsistent formatting.

**Proposal:**
- Add `scripts/healthcheck.sh` that runs:
  - link check for `docs/**/*.md` (e.g., `lychee` or a small python script)
  - markdown lint (optional)
  - verify required docs exist (`docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/PRD.md` if required)
- Add GitHub Action `healthcheck.yml` to run on PRs.

**Why now:** Very low product risk; improves quality signal for future PRDs.

**Acceptance:**
- `./scripts/healthcheck.sh` exits non-zero on broken links
- CI runs on PRs and blocks merges when failing

### B) PRD skeleton + example
**Problem:** PRDs can be vague; reviewers spend time clarifying basics.

**Proposal:**
- Add `docs/PRD_TEMPLATE.md` with explicit sections: problem, users, non-goals, success metrics, acceptance tests.
- Add a tiny example PRD (1 page) showing how to write measurable acceptance.

**Acceptance:**
- Template exists + linked from `docs/INDEX.md`

## Recommendation
Pick **A (Repo healthcheck + CI)** first.

## Promote to issue?
Yes, repo is idle and last promote was >6h ago.
