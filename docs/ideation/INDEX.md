# Ideation INDEX (tf-prd-lab)

Purpose: single entrypoint for small, PR-sized improvements (<=90 min), PRD-scoped, safe.

## Current top picks (actionable)

1) **/experiments list: Persist search/filter in URL query string**
   - Source: `runs/ideation-20260211-0212.md` (Card 2)
   - Why now: enables shareable views + better back/forward behavior.

2) **/experiments list: Quick search + tag filter (client-only)**
   - Source: `runs/ideation-20260210-0012.md` (Card 1)
   - Why now: improves discovery as experiment set grows.

3) **/experiments: Add a visible “Random experiment” button**
   - Source: `runs/ideation-20260209-2326.md` (Card 1)
   - Why now: aligns with “browse/discovery” workflow; easy to validate.
