# Ideation Run — 2026-02-13 14:12 KST

Repo: tf-prd-lab
Mode: product (PRD-scoped)
Constraints: PR-sized (<=90 min), safe, no CI/CD, no secrets

## Cards

### 1) /experiments list: Persist search + tag filters in URL query string (routing-aware)
- Problem: Filtering is ephemeral; navigating away/back or refresh resets state.
- User value: Shareable filtered views; better back/forward UX; improves exploration.
- Approach:
  - Bind search + tag filters to query params (e.g., `?q=...&tags=a,b`).
  - Initialize UI state from URL on first load.
  - Update URL via router replace (no full reload) on change.
  - Ensure empty/default state omits params.
- Acceptance:
  - Refresh preserves filters.
  - Back/forward traverses filter history.
  - Copy/paste URL reproduces the view.
- Verification: manual test; `pnpm build`.

### 2) /experiments list: Empty state with “Reset filters” action
- Problem: When filters yield no results, the page feels like a dead end.
- User value: Obvious recovery path; reduced confusion.
- Approach: Add an EmptyState with a reset button that clears query params + UI state.
- Acceptance: Reset returns to full list; URL returns to default.
- Verification: manual; `pnpm build`.

### 3) Experiment detail pages: “Copy link” + subtle toast
- Problem: Sharing a specific experiment is frictiony, especially on mobile.
- User value: One-tap sharing; encourages collaboration.
- Approach: Copy Link button using Clipboard API + fallback; toast for success/failure.
- Acceptance: Copies correct URL; doesn’t crash if permission denied.
- Verification: manual; `pnpm build`.
